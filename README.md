# Insurance Premium Prediction

### Problem Statement :
```bash
The goal of this project to give people an estimate of how much they need based on their individual health situation. After that, customers can work with any health insurance carrier and its plans and perks whilwe keeping the projected cost from our study in mind. This can assist a person in concentrating on the health side of an insurance policy rather than the ineffective part.
```

### Dataset :
```bash
The dataset is taken from a Kaggle. You can download the dataset from 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/noordeen/insurance-premium-prediction
```

### Database :
```bash
Database used is MongoDB
```

### Approach
```bash
Applying machine learing tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Model Building and model testing to build a solution that should able to predict the premium of the personal for health insurance.
```
### Data Exploration
```bash
Exploring the dataset using pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn.
```

### Exploratory Data Analysis
```bash
Plotted different graphs to get more insights about dependent and independent variables/features.
```
### Feature Engineering 
```bash
Categorical features encoded.
```

### Model Building
```bash
Model training done using various Machine Learning algorithms such as:
1.Linear Regression
2.Decision Tree Regressor
3.Random Forest Regressor
4.Extra Tree Regressor 
5.Gradient Boosting Regressor
6.XGBoost Regressor
7.KNN
8.AdaBoost Regressor
```

### Model Selection
```bash
Tested all the models to check the RMSE & R-squared.
```

### Webpage &Deployment
```bash
Created a web application that takes all the necessary inputs from the user & shows the output. Then deployed project on the AWS Platform.
